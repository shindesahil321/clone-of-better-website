# Better.com Clone

Welcome to the Better.com Clone project! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a close replica of the Better.com website, built using Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Flexbox layout. Our goal was to capture the essence of the original site, including a responsive navbar, hero section, and main content areas.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Responsive Navbar**: A navbar with a transparent background that changes color as you scroll. It includes links to key sections, a contact number, and a sign-in option.
- **Hero Section**: A striking hero section with a background color, a responsive image, and an "Apply Now" button that takes you to the application page.
- **Main Content**:
  - **Feature Cards**: Highlighting important features with eye-catching icons and descriptions.
  - **Testimonials**: A slider showcasing customer feedback with images and names.
  - **Additional Sections**: "Got questions? We've got answers" with sections for "Our Products," "Calculator," and "Guide," each filled with relevant content and images.
- **Footer**: A footer designed to match the Better.com look and feel.

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s how you can get this project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
